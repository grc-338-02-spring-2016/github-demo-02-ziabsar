<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

<p> <small>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small></p>
